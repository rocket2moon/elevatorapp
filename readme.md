Elevator App Readme
<br/>
This provides instructions on how to run an Elevator Console App written in C# using Visual Studio. This simple console application simulates elevator operations and can be a great starting point for learning C# and console app development.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Visual Studio
.NET SDK
Getting Started
Clone the Elevator Console App repository to your local machine or download and extract the source code (https://github.com/rocket2moon/elevatorapp).

Open Visual Studio.

In Visual Studio, go to File > Open > Project/Solution.

Navigate to the folder where you cloned or extracted the Elevator Console App source code and select the .csproj file.

Click the "Open" button to load the project.

Once the project is open, you can see the Program.cs file, which is the entry point to the functionality of the app.
Here is the structure of the application

Running the Elevator Console App
To run the Elevator Console App from Visual Studio, follow these steps:

In Visual Studio, locate the green "Start" button (usually with a play icon) on the toolbar. Click this button to build and run the application.

The console application will start, and you will see a command-line interface representing the elevator control panel.

Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the elevator simulation. You can press keys to move the elevator, open and close doors, and more.

To stop the elevator simulation, press the appropriate key as instructed or simply close the console window.

Modifying the Code
Feel free to explore and modify the code in the Program.cs file to experiment with different elevator behaviors or add new features. Visual Studio provides a rich development environment for C# projects, making it easy to edit, debug, and test your code.
